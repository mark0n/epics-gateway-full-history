#
# ORDER:
#  This will set the evaluation order that is used when a client requests
#  a PV. Setting this to "DENY, ALLOW" will allow access to a PV name that matches
#  both a DENY and an ALLOW pattern. (This is the default.)
#  NOTE: Matching DENY FROM patterns (with host names) will always override matching
#        ALLOW patterns.
#
# DENY / DENY FROM:
#  The gateway will completely ignore requests for any PV that matches the pattern.
#  Can be used to block the gateway from responding to groups of PVs.
#  Naming hosts (DENY FROM) will block the PVs only for the given hosts (useful to
#  prevent loops caused by forwarding to other gateways).
#
# ALIAS:
#  Define a PV alias. The gateway will transparently translate PV names to different
#  actual PV names on the control network it serves.
#  The actual name may contain the special escape sequences \0 ... \9 which will be
#  replaced by the n-th sub-expression matched.
#
# ALLOW:
#  Used to declare PV names which the Gateway should serve. Access security rules
#  to be used for PVs matched by this pattern may be specified. (Optional. The 
#  defaults are DEFAULT and 1.)
#
# Notes:
#  1) Commands are not case sensitive.
#  2) Pattern use GNU-style regular expressions. (See the documentation included
#     with the regex library for details on regular expressions.)
#  3) Any PV not included in an ALLOW command is not allowed access. 
#  4) See EPICS access security documentation for creating an access security
#     file for the PV gateway.

# Below:
#  - make ALLOW rules override DENY rules
#  - anything starting with ID is not allowed
#  - don't answer to any request from host gw1
#  - scummy0 ... scummy9 are translated to jbk_ai0 ... jbk_ai9 on real network;
#    users are allowed access according to access security rules for group jims_group
#  - requests for PVs starting with jbk_ will be allowed according to rules
#    for access security group jims_group
#  - PV food is allowed according to rules in group jims_group at access level 1
