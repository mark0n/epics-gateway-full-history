<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<h3><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h3>

<p>The Gateway is both a <a href="#ChannelAccess">Channel Access Server</a>
and <a href="#ChannelAccess">Channel Access Client</a> that provides a means
for many clients to access a process variable while making only one
connection to the server that owns the process variable. It also provides
additional access security beyond that on the server. The clients and the
server may be on different subnets, and the Gateway typically runs on a
machine with multiple network cards.</p>

<p>Previous versions of the Gateway worked with EPICS 3.13 but required a
special version of base to build and work correctly. The required changes
were never incorporated into EPICS base. The latest of these versions is
Gateway 1.3. The new version, starting as Gateway 2.0, only works with EPICS
3.14.2 or later and does not require a special EPICS base. It also has
additional features compared to Gateway 1.3. Note that even if you are using
EPICS 3.13 for your other applications, you can still use Gateway 2.0 built
with EPICS 3.14 as a gateway.</p>

<p>Note that for this guide we will often refer to the clients as <a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/extensions/medm/index.php">MEDM</a> and
the server as an IOC. This is (1) to avoid confusion with the client and
server parts of the Gateway and (2) because MEDM and IOCs are the most
typical and most used client and servers and most people are familiar with
them. Keep in mind, however, that there are many other clients than MEDM and
there are other types of servers than an IOC. The Gateway is, in fact,
another type of server.</p>

<p>The following is a diagram of several MEDMs connected through the Gateway
to a process variable in an IOC. Without the Gateway then would be a
connection from each MEDM to the IOC. This uses up extra resources in the
IOC.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="Gateway Connections"
src="Gateway.Connections.gif"></p>

<p>In addition, these MEDMs can be restricted in their access to the process
variable. A typical scenario is to allow only read access. Note that the
MEDMs see the Gateway as just another server, and the IOCs see the Gateway as
just another client. The IOCs could be on a different subnet from the MEDMs,
and in fact, the IOCs might not even be visible to the MEDMs without the
Gateway. In the case where the IOCs and the MEDMs are on different subnets,
the Gateway would be on a machine that has two network interface cards, one
to the MEDM subnet and one to the IOC subnet.</p>

<p>At the APS the main Gateway is for people in the office building to
connect to the machine network with read access only. There can be many users
connected to popular process variables, such as the one for the beam current.
There is only the one Gateway connection, however, to the IOC with that
process variable. It is little affected by all these users and can go about
its primary responsibility of helping keep the accelerator running. This
Gateway typically has connections to on the order of 10,000-30,000 process
variables in on the order of 300 IOCs. In addition the APS has one Gateway
for each experimental team. These teams have read access to machine process
variables and read/write access to their own process variables. There are on
the order of 30 Gateways running at the APS.</p>

<p>In addition to connections to process variables in IOCs and other servers,
the Gateway, as a server, provides its own <a
href="#ProcessVariables">internal process variables</a>. These are used for
diagnostic purposes, to initiate reports, and to control the Gateway.</p>

<p>Internally the Gateway maintains two objects for each process variable.
There is a PV (Process Variable) object that handles the Gateway client
connections to the IOC, and there is a VC (Virtual Connection) object that
handles the Gateway server connections. Each VC has a list of Chan (Channel)
connections to the MEDMs. The PV object implements the client side of the
Gateway, and the VC object and its Chans implement the server side. The
following picture shows three typical states for these objects.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="Gateway Internals"
src="Gateway.Internals.gif"></p>

<p>In the top state there is no connection to the IOC, either because it is
still trying to connect or because the connection has been lost. In that case
there is no VC, and the MEDMs see the process variable as not existing. In
this case the PV object is destroyed after two minutes unless it connects.
The middle state is most typical. There is a connection to the IOC and each
MEDM is connected through the VC. In the lower state the PV is connected to
the IOC, but there are no MEDMs interested in the process variable. The PV
object and connection to the IOC are maintained for two hours after the last
time they are used in case another MEDM or (other client) wants to use it
again. The other client could be command-line program like caget, that
requests the value and then exits.</p>

<p>When a Channel Access Client wants to connect to a process variable, it
send out a series of search requests, which are UDP packets on the network.
These packets are initially sent at a very fast rate with the time between
them doubling at each try until 100 are sent or there is an affirmative
reply. Each server that gets such a packet is required to determine if it has
the process variable. When the Gateway gets such a request, it creates a PV
object which itself sends a search request to the IOCs. This PV starts out
as<strong>Connecting</strong> and the Gateway responds to the search request
as postponed. If it does not connect in a very short time, it becomes
<strong>Dead</strong> and the Gateway responds to subsequent search requests
as not having it. If it is not found by the Gateway after two minutes, the PV
is destroyed. If it becomes connected to an IOC, its state becomes
<strong>Active</strong> and the VC is created. The Gateway then responds to
subsequent search requests as having the process variable, and soon after a
Chan is created and the MEDM is connected to the VC and through it to the PV.
If the connection is then lost, the VC and its Chans are destroyed, and the
PV becomes <strong>Disconnected</strong>. PVs are either
<strong>Alive</strong> or <strong>Unconnected</strong>.
<strong>Alive</strong> consists of either <strong>Active</strong> or
<strong>Inactive</strong>. <strong>Unconnected</strong> consists of
<strong>Connecting</strong>, <strong>Dead</strong>, or
<strong>Disconnected</strong>. (The lack of intuitive symmetry between
<strong>Alive</strong> and <strong>Dead</strong> and the other semantics is
historical and regrettable.) The top state in the picture is
<strong>Unconnected,</strong> but it is not clear whether it is
<strong>Connecting</strong>, <strong>Dead</strong>, or
<strong>Disconnected</strong>. The middle state is <strong>Alive
</strong>and<strong> Active</strong>. The bottom state is
<strong>Alive</strong> and <strong>Inactive</strong>.<a
href="#ProcessVariables">Internal process variables</a> in the Gateway give
the number of PVs in each state, and can be used to monitor its behavior. In
order to interpret the results, it is necessary to have an understanding of
these states. Remember:</p>
<ul>
  <li>total = alive + unconnected</li>
  <li>alive = active + inactive</li>
  <li>unconnected = connecting + dead + disconnected</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="History">History</a></h3>

<p>The Gateway was originally written by Jim Kowalkowski of the APS starting
in early 1996. Its basic concept and structure owes to him, but it was never
really finished and did not work well or reliably. Janet Anderson did some
work on it after Jim left the APS. Kenneth Evans took it over in 1999, spent
several months on it, and made it work. This required making several changes
to EPICS base, however. These changes were never incorporated into EPICS
base, and it hence required a special version of base to be built. Ralph
Lange of BESSY also worked on the earlier version and took the Gateway over
in 2001, adding regular expressions to the process variable specifications
and making it work with the Alarm Handler. Kenneth Evans converted it to
EPICS 3.14 in mid-2002, working with Jeff Hill of LANL, the person in charge
of <a href="#ChannelAccess">Channel Access</a>. There were problems with the
3.14 versions of Channel Access and these were slowly resolved over the
period until late spring 2003. It now works acceptably with EPICS 3.14,
requires no special version of base, and uses appreciably less CPU than
Gateway 1.3.</p>

<p>A typical command line is:</p>
<pre>% gateway -log gateway.log -cip 164.54.3.255 -sip 164.54.188.65 -server</pre>

<p>With EPICS 3.13, there should be no more than one portable server, such as
Gateway, running on a workstation. The reason is that there is not sufficient
information in the beacons to distinguish among servers on the same host.
Clients such as MEDM must treat their beacons as one set of beacon signals
and will see sum and difference frequencies. They will likely interpret this
as an IOC coming up and will continuously reissue their search requests. As a
result, if the Gateway is one of two portable servers on the same host, it
will be causing a problem. Two servers on the same host should not be a
problem with 3.14 servers. It is not clear what will happen with a mixture of
3.13 and 3.14 servers. That situation should be avoided.</p>

<h2><a name="Report">Reports</a></h2>

<p>Gateway prints reports to the log file.</p>

<h2><a name="ProcessVariables">Gateway Process Variables</a></h2>

<p>The Gateway publishes several process variables, allowing you to control
it and monitor it. By default these have a prefix which is the name of the
host machine, but this can be changed by<a href="#Starting"> command-line
options</a>. Here, we will use the prefix "gateway". See the <a
href="#Introduction">Introduction</a> for a more detailed description of the
states.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.vctotal</strong></p>

<p>This is the total number of VC objects and should be the same as
gateway.active.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.pvtotal</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of PV objects.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.connected</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of connected PV objects, that is, process variables for
which the Gateway has a working connection to the IOC. The connections may be
active or inactive.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.active</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of active or inactive connections. The connection is
active if an MEDM is attached to the Gateway and using the process
variable</p>

<p><strong>gateway.inactive</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of inactive connections. The connection is inactive if
no MEDM connected to the Gateway is using it.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.unconnected</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of PV objects which are connecting, dead, or
disconnected. There is no working connection to an IOC but the PV object is
still around.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.connecting</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of PV objects that have just been created and are
trying to connect to an IOC.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.disconnected</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of PV objects that were formerly connected but have
lost the connection.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.fd</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of file descriptors in use by the Gateway. This process
variable will only be available if registering file descriptors is enabled in
the Gateway when it is built. Not registering them appears to significantly
decrease the CPU usage, so this process variable will probably not be
available.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.clientEventRate</strong></p>

<p>This is the rate in Hz at which client events are happening. Client events
include such things as connection notifications, read and write
verifications, value changes, and access rights changes. They relate to
communication from the IOC.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.postEventRate</strong></p>

<p>This is the rate in Hz at which events are posted from the VC object to
CAS and hence to the MEDMs. It is independent of the number of MEDMs
(providing there is at least one). It tends to be similar to the
clientEventRate.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.existTestRate</strong></p>

<p>This is the rate in Hz at which the Gateway receives search requests. For
each search request, it has to do an <strong>Exist Test</strong> to see if it
has the process variable or not. If it is not already connected to the
process variable, it creates a PV object and itself initiates a series of
search requests to the IOCs. See the <a href="#Introduction">Introduction</a>
for more information on search requests. Exist Tests put a load on the
Gateway. For process variables that do not exist, there can be many of them
that are unsuccessful. See <a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/extensions/caSnooper/index.php">CaSnooper</a>
for a tool to monitor Exist Tests.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.loopRate</strong></p>

<p>This is the rate in HZ at which the gateway executes is main loop. The
main loop consists of a call to CAS followed by a call to CAC followed by
Gateway housekeeping routines. The call to CAS lasts for 10 ms unless there
is activity on a file descriptor, in which case it returns early, or if it
takes longer than that to process its callbacks, in which case it returns
late. The call to CAC takes as long as it takes to do the work required. The
Gateway housekeeping generally uses comparatively little time. As the Gateway
becomes loaded down, the calls to CAS take longer and so do the calls to CAC
until eventually all the available CPU time is used. As the load increases
the loopRate tends to decrease. However, no load can have a lower loop rate
than with some load because the call to CAS waits the whole 10 ms. It is a
rule of thumb that CAC should be called at least every 100 ms. By examining
the loopRate you can tell if this is happening. It should remain above 10
Hz.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.cpuFract</strong></p>

<p>This is the fraction of the available CPU time that is being used by the
Gateway. It is a good monitor of the load on the Gateway. On WIN32 the
cpuFract is always 1 and on Linux, it is always 0. This is owing to their
implementation of the clock() function.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.serverEventRate</strong></p>

<p>This is the rate in Hz at which CAS processes events. It tends to be the
clientEventRate multiplied by the number of MEDMs.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.serverPostRate</strong></p>

<p>This is the rate in Hz at which events are posted to CAS. If the Gateway
is keeping up, this will be very close to the serverEventRate. If not, it
will be higher and all posted events will not have been processed.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.commandFlag</strong></p>

<p>Writing a 1 to this process variable causes the Command File to be
processed. The process variable is reset to 0 after the Command File is
processed.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.report1Flag</strong></p>

<p>Writing a 1 to this process variable causes Report 1 to be written to the
log file. Report 1 is the VC report.The process variable is reset to 0
afterward.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.report2Flag</strong></p>

<p>Writing a 1 to this process variable causes Report 2 to be written to the
log file. Report 2 is the PV report.The process variable is reset to 0
afterward.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.report3Flag</strong></p>

<p>Writing a 1 to this process variable causes Report 3 to be written to the
log file. Report 3 is the access security report. The process variable is
reset to 0 afterward.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.newAsFlag</strong></p>

<p>Writing a 1 to this process variable causes the access security file to be
reread. The process variable is reset to 0 afterward. There is currently a
problem on some platforms that files can only be opened using file
descriptors 0 to 255. If there are many CA socket connections, there may not
be a file descriptor in this range available. In that case the access
security file will not be read and an error will appear in the log.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.quitFlag</strong></p>

<p>Writing a 1 to this process variable causes the Gateway process to exit.
If the Gateway is in server mode, it will be restarted as a new process. In
that case it functions more as a reset.</p>

<p><strong>gateway.quitServerFlag</strong></p>

<p>Writing a 1 to this process variable causes the Gateway server process to
end, also ending the current Gateway. No more gateways will be started by the
current server. If the gateway is not in server mode, it has the same effect
as gateway.quitFlag.</p>

<h2><a name="GUIInterface">GUI Interface</a></h2>

<p>Owing to its <a href="#ProcessVariables">published process variables</a>,
you can monitor and control the Gateway via MEDM or another tool. You can set
the writable process variables and cause the Gateway to print reports, reread
the access security file, or quit. This is an example MEDM screen:</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="hydraStats.adl" src="hydraStats.adl.gif"></p>

<p>You could also add a Shell Command button to run a script to start the
Gateway. The MEDM ADL file for this screen is included in the Gateway
distribution as hydraStats.adl.</p>

<p>It is convenient to monitor and possibly record the state of the Gateway
using <a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/extensions/StripTool/index.php">StripTool.</a>
You could, of course, use any other EPICS monitoring tool of your choice.
This is an example of using StripTool:</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="hydra.rate.stp" src="hydra.rate.stp.gif"></p>

<p>The StripTool configuration file for this image is included in the Gateway
distribution as hydra.rate.stp. Note that the cpuFract is low, the loop rate
is high, and the postRate's and eventRate's are nearly equal, indicating the
Gateway is healthy.</p>

<p>This is a screen that shows the status of all of the APS Gateways:</p>

<p align="left"><img alt="GatewayOverview.adl"
src="GatewayOverview.adl.gif"></p>

<p>The values for inactive and dead are not being used because these are
mostly using Gateway 1.3, and those process variables did not exist for
Gateway 1.3.</p>

<h2><a name="ChannelAccess">Channel Access</a></h2>

<p><strong>Channel Access</strong> [CA] is the part of EPICS that governs
communication between servers and clients. The two major parts are the
<strong>Channel Access Server</strong> [CAS] and <strong>Channel Access
Client</strong> [CAC, sometimes also just CA since there was originally no
CAS]. A CAC, such as MEDM uses functions in the CAC library for communication
with EPICS and provides its own specific functionality on top of that. A
server uses the CAS library for communication with EPICS and also provides
its own specific functionality. A program that uses CAS is called a
<strong>Server Tool</strong> to distinguish it from the CAS library itself.
Servers that use CAS are called<strong> Portable Servers</strong>. The
Gateway is a ServerTool, a Portable Server, a Channel Access Server, and also
a Channel Access Client. There are also <strong>Soft IOC</strong>s, which,
like Portable Servers, run on platforms such as Solaris, WIN32, and Linux.
These do not currently use CAS and are not Portable Servers.</p>

<p>You can find out more information by looking at the EPICS Channel Access
Reference Manual and the Application Developers Guide. There is a version
included with each EPICS release. They can be found by starting at <a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/index.php">IOC Software</a> in the
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/docs">EPICS Documentation</a> and
following links to the release and point release of the desired EPICS
base.</p>
